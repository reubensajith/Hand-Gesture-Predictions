# Hand Gesture Prediction

There are two ways of predicting the hand gesture.
### Type 1 - Annotate the image and predict the gesture using the annotations
In this method we train a model on already annotated points to predict annotations for the images. These annotations are used to predict the gesture. For the first model we have trained a CNN model and for the second model model we have a simple neural network.


### Type 2 - Build a deep neural network to predict the gesture from the image directly.
We train a CNN model with raw images of different gestures to predict.
